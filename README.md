# 2D-Particle-Simulations



This repository features several scripts for simulating non-relativistic elastic 2D collisions. In all cases, the particles are modeled as circles. 

## REQUIREMENTS
**ANACONDA PYTHON** recommended (need version information). While recommended, *Anaconda* is not required. A *Python3* distribution with the following modules are required: *numpy*, *random*, *matplotlib*, (finish list). 

The two simulations in the following table feature various collision scenarious with equal mass and radius particles represented by circles.

This simulation adds a uniform gravity field to the *Hard Circle Box* above.

These two simulations uses a circle as the enclosing boundary. The intention is to demonstrate the changes required to handle different boundary conditions.

The following table shows the TBD simulations that feature collisions with particles represented by circles with different radii and masses.

The last simulation features hard-sphere elatic collions in a pentagon. While this simulation is a bit "...and now for something completely different" its purpose is to create something like an application for the type of physics represented in this repository.
